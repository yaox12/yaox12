### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in 2016 and Ph.D. degree in 2021 (advised by Prof. Lifeng Sun) from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. My research is mainly focused on federated learning, lifelong/continual learning, and transfer learning during the postgraduate period.

Currently I am a software engineer at DevTech, NVIDIA.
